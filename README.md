# Deployment Practice

In this practice project I take a full stack web app in a development environment and deploy it to a DigitalOcean droplet. I'm doing this so that I don't botch my portfolio website's actual deployment.

## Snippets

`docker compose run app django-admin startproject django_project .`

## Reference Material
